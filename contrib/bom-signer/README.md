# Signed BOMs

BOMs generated by cdxgen for the released artifacts are signed with a default private key (stored as a repository secret). Use the public key in this directory to verify the BOMs.

```shell
export SBOM_SIGN_ALGORITHM=RS512
export SBOM_SIGN_PUBLIC_KEY=public.key

cdx-verify -i bom.json --public-key /path/to/public.key
```

NOTE: This is not a security feature. We might rotate the keys now and then, but have no plans to implement default signing with a global key, etc.
